      "I have always been passionate about computers and technology in general, so much so that I started a degree in electrical engineering to be able to create my own tech, then, almost 5 years ago, a nice job opportunity knoecked at my door that would involve developing a hardware for a GPS tracker, and compatible firmware to go with it, and that's when I started writing software. A couple years ago and I moved to a software house, now only working in the frontend part of the apps in React. Then, another couple yeas passed and I joined another company yet, where i had the opportunity to work as a fullstack enginner both in Frontend and Backend",
